## Introduction
This Hamburger restaurant menu is made as part of a course from [@cmda-minor-web 18-19](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/css-to-the-rescue-1819). In this course I had to make a menu without any JavaScript. The idea was to write as much Vanilla HTML and CSS as possible. The end product is a menu full of animations, transitions and keyframe effects.
